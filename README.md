### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Joshua!

As a full stack engineer, I possess proficiency across an array of languages: Python, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. My expertise extends to frameworks like React, Redux, Flask, and Express. My passion revolves around creating refined, user-centric products that effectively address real-world needs. Originating from a nutrition and health background, programming has seamlessly evolved into my primary medium for nurturing my unending curiosity, refining my knack for problem-solving, and giving wings to my creative expression!
